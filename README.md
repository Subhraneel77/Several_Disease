2. **Data Collection:** Relevant medical data, including patient demographics, diagnostic tests, and health metrics, are collected for training and evaluation.
3. **Machine Learning Models:** Various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, and Neural Networks are utilized to build predictive models for each disease.
4. **Feature Engineering:** The input features are carefully selected and engineered, including blood test results, patient age, gender, medical history, and more.
5. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing techniques such as normalization, feature scaling, and handling missing values are applied to ensure accurate model performance.
6. **Model Training:** The predictive models are trained on labeled data, and their hyperparameters are tuned for optimal performance.
7. **Performance Evaluation:** The models are rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves to assess their predictive capability.
8. **User Interface:** A user-friendly web interface is developed using frameworks like Streamlit, allowing users to input their medical data and receive disease predictions.
9. **Real-time Predictions:** Once deployed, the system can provide real-time predictions based on patient input, aiding healthcare providers in making timely decisions.
10. **Interpretability:** Techniques such as feature importance analysis are employed to explain the reasoning behind each prediction, enhancing the transparency of the system.
